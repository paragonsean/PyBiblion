### [Early Access Version]
######  The [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12928) are currently undergoing peer review, and the code may be adjusted at any time. If you have any issues about the paper or this repo, contact us via Email: oceanytech@gmail.com or issues as you prefer.

## Introduction

This repository contains the official code implementation for the Paper [A Literature Review of Literature Reviews in Pattern Analysis and Machine
Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12928). Our goal is to provide a set of tools to assist researchers and scholars in conducting efficient and in-depth bibliometric analyses in the field.

Note: The term "biblion" is derived from the ancient Greek word "Î²Î¹Î²Î»Î¯Î¿Î½" (biblÃ­on), means book or literature.

## Features

- **Meta-data Retrieval**: Automated tools for fetching literature data from multiple databases.
- **Data Analysis**: Offers a variety of literature data analysis tools, including but not limited to keyword extraction, and metric calculation.
- **Visualization**: Generates intuitive charts and diagrams to help understand the distribution and relationships within the literature data.
- **Extensibility**: The code is structured clearly, making it easy for other researchers to modify and extend according to their needs.

## News and Updates
* 2024.04.25 ðŸ”¥ We've integrated the popular Langchain (with OpenAI 1.0 version enabled) into our framework, making everything GPT-related run smoother and faster. 
Now, you can calculate our metrics with only **one line of code**!!! Just kick off with `S2paper('INPUT TITLE HERE').TNCSI`.
