algorithms neglect directional information, in this paper, a directional
approach is presented to suppress structural backgrounds and develop a more
effective detection algorithm. To this end, a similar concept to the average
absolute gray difference (AAGD) is utilized to construct a novel directional
small target detection algorithm called absolute directional mean difference
(ADMD). Also, an efficient implementation procedure is presented for the
proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm effectively enhances the target area
and eliminates background clutter. Simulation results on real infrared images

            <p id="citation-2">Infrared small target detection is a key technique in infrared search and
tracking (IRST) systems. Although deep learning has been widely used in the
vision tasks of visible light images recently, it is rarely used in infrared
small target detection due to the difficulty in learning small target features.
In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight convolutional neural network
TBC-Net for infrared small target detection. The TBCNet consists of a target
extraction module (TEM) and a semantic constraint module (SCM), which are used
to extract small targets from infrared images and to classify the extracted
target images during the training, respectively. Meanwhile, we propose a joint
loss function and a training method. The SCM imposes a semantic constraint on
TEM by combining the high-level classification task and solve the problem of
the difficulty to learn features caused by class imbalance problem. During the
training, the targets are extracted from the input image and then be classified
by SCM. During the inference, only the TEM is used to detect the small targets.
We also propose a data synthesis method to generate training data. The
experimental results show that compared with the traditional methods, TBC-Net
can better reduce the false alarm caused by complicated background, the
proposed network structure and joint loss have a significant improvement on
small target feature learning. Besides, TBC-Net can achieve real-time detection
on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier development board, which is suitable for
applications such as field research with drones equipped with infrared sensors.</p>

            <p id="citation-3">The technique of detecting multiple dim and small targets with low
signal-to-clutter ratios (SCR) is very important for infrared search and
tracking systems. In this paper, we establish a detection method derived from
maximal entropy random walk (MERW) to robustly detect multiple small targets.
Initially, we introduce the primal MERW and analyze the feasibility of applying
it to small target detection. However, the original weight matrix of the MERW
is sensitive to interferences. Therefore, a specific weight matrix is designed
for the MERW in principle of enhancing characteristics of small targets and
suppressing strong clutters. Moreover, the primal MERW has a critical
limitation of strong bias to the most salient small target. To achieve multiple
small targets detection, we develop a hierarchical version of the MERW method.
Based on the hierarchical MERW (HMERW), we propose a small target detection
method as follows. First, filtering technique is used to smooth the infrared
image. Second, an output map is obtained by importing the filtered image into
the HMERW. Then, a coefficient map is constructed to fuse the stationary
dirtribution map of the HMERW. Finally, an adaptive threshold is used to
segment multiple small targets from the fusion map. Extensive experiments on
practical data sets demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the
state-of-the-art methods in terms of target enhancement, background suppression
and multiple small targets detection.</p>

            <p id="citation-4">Infrared small target detection is an important fundamental task in the
infrared system. Therefore, many infrared small target detection methods have
been proposed, in which the low-rank model has been used as a powerful tool.
However, most low-rank-based methods assign the same weights for different
singular values, which will lead to inaccurate background estimation.
Considering that different singular values have different importance and should
be treated discriminatively, in this paper, we propose a non-convex tensor
low-rank approximation (NTLA) method for infrared small target detection. In
our method, NTLA regularization adaptively assigns different weights to
different singular values for accurate background estimation. Based on the
proposed NTLA, we propose asymmetric spatial-temporal total variation (ASTTV)
regularization to achieve more accurate background estimation in complex
scenes. Compared with the traditional total variation approach, ASTTV exploits
different smoothness intensities for spatial and temporal regularization. We
design an efficient algorithm to find the optimal solution of our method.
Compared with some state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method achieves an
improvement in terms of various evaluation metrics. Extensive experimental
results in various complex scenes demonstrate that our method has strong
robustness and low false-alarm rate. Code is available at

small target detection is one of the most difficult problems in the field of
computer vision. In most existing studies, semantic segmentation methods are
typically used to achieve better results. The centroid of each target is
calculated from the segmentation map as the detection result. In contrast, we
propose a novel end-to-end framework for infrared small target detection and
segmentation in this paper. First, with the use of UNet as the backbone to
maintain resolution and semantic information, our model can achieve a higher
detection accuracy than other state-of-the-art methods by attaching a simple
anchor-free head. Then, a pyramid pool module is used to further extract
features and improve the precision of target segmentation. Next, we use
semantic segmentation tasks that pay more attention to pixel-level features to
assist in the training process of object detection, which increases the average
precision and allows the model to detect some targets that were previously not
detectable. Furthermore, we develop a multi-task framework for infrared small
target detection and segmentation. Our multi-task learning model reduces
complexity by nearly half and speeds up inference by nearly twice compared to
the composite single-task model, while maintaining accuracy. The code and

infrared search and tracking system. Since the local regions similar to
infrared small-dim targets spread over the whole background, exploring the
interaction information amongst image features in large-range dependencies to
mine the difference between the target and background is crucial for robust
detection. However, existing deep learning-based methods are limited by the
locality of convolutional neural networks, which impairs the ability to capture
large-range dependencies. Additionally, the small-dim appearance of the
infrared target makes the detection model highly possible to miss detection. To
this end, we propose a robust and general infrared small-dim target detection
method with the transformer. We adopt the self-attention mechanism of the
transformer to learn the interaction information of image features in a larger
range. Moreover, we design a feature enhancement module to learn discriminative
features of small-dim targets to avoid miss detection. After that, to avoid the
loss of the target information, we adopt a decoder with the U-Net-like skip
connection operation to contain more information of small-dim targets. Finally,
we get the detection result by a segmentation head. Extensive experiments on

            <p id="citation-8">Infrared small target detection plays an important role in the infrared
search and tracking applications. In recent years, deep learning techniques
were introduced to this task and achieved noteworthy effects. Following general
object segmentation methods, existing deep learning methods usually processed
the image from the global view. However, the imaging locality of small targets
and extreme class-imbalance between the target and background pixels were not
well-considered by these deep learning methods, which causes the low-efficiency
on training and high-dependence on numerous data. A local patch network (LPNet)
with global attention is proposed in this paper to detect small targets by
jointly considering the global and local properties of infrared small target
images. From the global view, a supervised attention module trained by the
small target spread map is proposed to suppress most background pixels
irrelevant with small target features. From the local view, local patches are
split from global features and share the same convolution weights with each
other in a patch net. By leveraging both the global and local properties, the
data-driven framework proposed in this paper has fused multi-scale features for
small target detection. Extensive synthetic and real data experiments show that
the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with
existing both conventional and deep learning methods.</p>

ISTD aims at separating small targets from complex background clutter. The
infrared radiation decays over distances, making the targets highly dim and
prone to confusion with the background clutter, which makes the detector
challenging to balance the precision and recall rate. To deal with this
difficulty, this paper proposes a neural-network-based ISTD method called
CourtNet, which has three sub-networks: the prosecution network is designed for
improving the recall rate; the defendant network is devoted to increasing the
precision rate; the jury network weights their results to adaptively balance
the precision and recall rate. Furthermore, the prosecution network utilizes a
densely connected transformer structure, which can prevent small targets from
disappearing in the network forward propagation. In addition, a fine-grained
attention module is adopted to accurately locate the small targets.
Experimental results show that CourtNet achieves the best F1-score on the two
ISTD datasets, MFIRST (0.62) and SIRST (0.73).</p>

challenging task, due to the extreme imbalance between target and background,
bounding box regression is extremely sensitive to infrared small targets, and
small target information is easy to lose in the high-level semantic layer. In
this paper, we propose an enhancing feature learning network (EFLNet) based on

extremely imbalance between the target and the background in the infrared
image, which makes the model pay more attention to the background features,

adaptive threshold focal loss function that adjusts the loss weight
automatically, compelling the model to allocate greater attention to target
features. Second, we introduce the normalized Gaussian Wasserstein distance to
alleviate the difficulty of model convergence caused by the extreme sensitivity
of the bounding box regression to infrared small targets. Finally, we
incorporate a dynamic head mechanism into the network to enable adaptive
learning of the relative importance of each semantic layer. Experimental

            <p id="citation-13">Infrared small target detection is a technique for finding small targets from
infrared clutter background. Due to the dearth of high-level semantic
information, small infrared target features are weakened in the deep layers of
the CNN, which underachieves the CNN's representation ability. To address the
above problem, in this paper, we propose an infrared low-level network (ILNet)
that considers infrared small targets as salient areas with little semantic
information. Unlike other SOTA methods, ILNet pays greater attention to
low-level information instead of treating them equally. A new lightweight
feature fusion module, named Interactive Polarized Orthogonal Fusion module
(IPOF), is proposed, which integrates more important low-level features from
the shallow layers into the deep layers. A Dynamic One-Dimensional Aggregation
layers (DODA) are inserted into the IPOF, to dynamically adjust the aggregation
of low dimensional information according to the number of input channels. In
addition, the idea of ensemble learning is used to design a Representative
Block (RB) to dynamically allocate weights for shallow and deep layers.
Experimental results on the challenging NUAA-SIRST (78.22% nIoU and 1.33e-6 Fa)
and IRSTD-1K (68.91% nIoU and 3.23e-6 Fa) dataset demonstrate that the proposed
ILNet can get better performances than other SOTA methods. Moreover, ILNet can
obtain a greater improvement with the increasement of data volume. Training

difficult problem, for the differences between targets and backgrounds are not
easy to distinguish. Background reconstruction is one of the methods to deal
with this problem. This paper proposes an ISTD method based on background
reconstruction called Dynamic Background Reconstruction (DBR). DBR consists of
three modules: a dynamic shift window module (DSW), a background reconstruction
module (BR), and a detection head (DH). BR takes advantage of Vision
Transformers in reconstructing missing patches and adopts a grid masking
strategy with a masking ratio of 50\% to reconstruct clean backgrounds without
targets. To avoid dividing one target into two neighboring patches, resulting
in reconstructing failure, DSW is performed before input embedding. DSW
calculates offsets, according to which infrared images dynamically shift. To
reduce False Positive (FP) cases caused by regarding reconstruction errors as
targets, DH utilizes a structure of densely connected Transformer to further
improve the detection performance. Experimental results show that DBR achieves
the best F1-score on the two ISTD datasets, MFIRST (64.10\%) and SIRST
(75.01\%).</p>

            <p id="citation-18">Many state-of-the-art methods have been proposed for infrared small target
detection. They work well on the images with homogeneous backgrounds and
high-contrast targets. However, when facing highly heterogeneous backgrounds,
they would not perform very well, mainly due to: 1) the existence of strong
edges and other interfering components, 2) not utilizing the priors fully.
Inspired by this, we propose a novel method to exploit both local and non-local
priors simultaneously. Firstly, we employ a new infrared patch-tensor (IPT)
model to represent the image and preserve its spatial correlations. Exploiting
the target sparse prior and background non-local self-correlation prior, the
target-background separation is modeled as a robust low-rank tensor recovery
problem. Moreover, with the help of the structure tensor and reweighted idea,
we design an entry-wise local-structure-adaptive and sparsity enhancing weight
to replace the globally constant weighting parameter. The decomposition could
be achieved via the element-wise reweighted higher-order robust principal
component analysis with an additional convergence condition according to the
practical situation of target detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our model outperforms the other state-of-the-arts, in particular for the images
with very dim targets and heavy clutters.</p>

Low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) of target and the interference caused by
irregular background clutter make it difficult to get an accurate result. In
this paper, small targets are considered to have two characteristics of high
contrast and isotropy, and we propose a multilayer gray difference (MGD) method

            <p id="citation-21">Infrared small target detection plays an important role in the remote sensing
fields. Therefore, many detection algorithms have been proposed, in which the
infrared patch-tensor (IPT) model has become a mainstream tool due to its
excellent performance. However, most IPT-based methods face great challenges,
such as inaccurate measure of the tensor low-rankness and poor robustness to
complex scenes, which will leadto poor detection performance. In order to solve
these problems, this paper proposes a novel double-weighted multi-granularity
infrared patch tensor (DWMGIPT) model. First, to capture different granularity
information of tensor from multiple modes, a multi-granularity infrared patch
tensor (MGIPT) model is constructed by collecting nonoverlapping patches and
tensor augmentation based on the tensor train (TT) decomposition. Second, to
explore the latent structure of tensor more efficiently, we utilize the
auto-weighted mechanism to balance the importance of information at different
granularity. Then, the steering kernel (SK) is employed to extract local
structure prior, which suppresses background interference such as strong edges
and noise. Finally, an efficient optimization algorithm based on the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is presented to solve the
model. Extensive experiments in various challenging scenes show that the
proposed algorithm is robust to noise and different scenes. Compared with the
other eight state-of-the-art methods, different evaluation metrics demonstrate
that our method achieves better detection performance in various complex

task due to a lack of inherent characteristics, imprecise bounding box
regression, a scarcity of real-world datasets, and sensitive localization
evaluation. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive solution to these
challenges. First, we find that the existing anchor-free label assignment
method is prone to mislabeling small targets as background, leading to their
omission by detectors. To overcome this issue, we propose an all-scale
pseudo-box-based label assignment scheme that relaxes the constraints on scale
and decouples the spatial assignment from the size of the ground-truth target.
Second, motivated by the structured prior of feature pyramids, we introduce the
one-stage cascade refinement network (OSCAR), which uses the high-level head as
soft proposals for the low-level refinement head. This allows OSCAR to process
the same target in a cascade coarse-to-fine manner. Finally, we present a new
research benchmark for infrared small target detection, consisting of the
SIRST-V2 dataset of real-world, high-resolution single-frame targets, the
normalized contrast evaluation metric, and the DeepInfrared toolkit for
detection. We conduct extensive ablation studies to evaluate the components of
OSCAR and compare its performance to state-of-the-art model-driven and

targets in a fully supervised manner has gained remarkable research interests
in recent years, but is highly labor expensive since a large number of
per-pixel annotations are required. To handle this problem, in this paper, we
make the first attempt to achieve infrared small target detection with
point-level supervision. Interestingly, during the training phase supervised by
point labels, we discover that CNNs first learn to segment a cluster of pixels
near the targets, and then gradually converge to predict groundtruth point
labels. Motivated by this "mapping degeneration" phenomenon, we propose a label
evolution framework named label evolution with single point supervision (LESPS)
to progressively expand the point label by leveraging the intermediate
predictions of CNNs. In this way, the network predictions can finally
approximate the updated pseudo labels, and a pixel-level target mask can be
obtained to train CNNs in an end-to-end manner. We conduct extensive
experiments with insightful visualizations to validate the effectiveness of our
method. Experimental results show that CNNs equipped with LESPS can well
recover the target masks from corresponding point labels, {and can achieve over
70% and 95% of their fully supervised performance in terms of pixel-level
intersection over union (IoU) and object-level probability of detection (Pd),

            <p id="citation-26">Single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection aims at separating small
targets from clutter backgrounds. With the advances of deep learning, CNN-based
methods have yielded promising results in generic object detection due to their
powerful modeling capability. However, existing CNN-based methods cannot be
directly applied for infrared small targets since pooling layers in their
networks could lead to the loss of targets in deep layers. To handle this
problem, we propose a dense nested attention network (DNANet) in this paper.
Specifically, we design a dense nested interactive module (DNIM) to achieve
progressive interaction among high-level and low-level features. With the
repeated interaction in DNIM, infrared small targets in deep layers can be
maintained. Based on DNIM, we further propose a cascaded channel and spatial
attention module (CSAM) to adaptively enhance multi-level features. With our
DNANet, contextual information of small targets can be well incorporated and
fully exploited by repeated fusion and enhancement. Moreover, we develop an
infrared small target dataset (namely, NUDT-SIRST) and propose a set of
evaluation metrics to conduct comprehensive performance evaluation. Experiments
on both public and our self-developed datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves
better performance in terms of probability of detection (Pd), false-alarm rate
(Fa), and intersection of union (IoU).</p>

            <p id="citation-27">Infrared small target detection (ISTD) has attracted widespread attention and
been applied in various fields. Due to the small size of infrared targets and
the noise interference from complex backgrounds, the performance of ISTD using
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is restricted. Moreover, the constriant
that long-distance dependent features can not be encoded by the vanilla CNNs
also impairs the robustness of capturing targets' shapes and locations in
complex scenarios. To this end, a multi-patch attention network (MPANet) based
on the axial-attention encoder and the multi-scale patch branch (MSPB)
structure is proposed. Specially, an axial-attention-improved encoder
architecture is designed to highlight the effective features of small targets
and suppress background noises. Furthermore, the developed MSPB structure fuses
the coarse-grained and fine-grained features from different semantic scales.
Extensive experiments on the SIRST dataset show the superiority performance and
effectiveness of the proposed MPANet compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

            <p id="citation-28">The detection of small infrared targets against blurred and cluttered
backgrounds has remained an enduring challenge. In recent years, learning-based
schemes have become the mainstream methodology to establish the mapping
directly. However, these methods are susceptible to the inherent complexities
of changing backgrounds and real-world disturbances, leading to unreliable and
compromised target estimations. In this work, we propose a bi-level adversarial
framework to promote the robustness of detection in the presence of distinct
corruptions. We first propose a bi-level optimization formulation to introduce
dynamic adversarial learning. Specifically, it is composited by the learnable
generation of corruptions to maximize the losses as the lower-level objective
and the robustness promotion of detectors as the upper-level one. We also
provide a hierarchical reinforced learning strategy to discover the most
detrimental corruptions and balance the performance between robustness and
accuracy. To better disentangle the corruptions from salient features, we also
propose a spatial-frequency interaction network for target detection. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our scheme remarkably improves 21.96% IOU across a wide
array of corruptions and notably promotes 4.97% IOU on the general benchmark.

            <p id="citation-29">Infrared small target super-resolution (SR) aims to recover reliable and
detailed high-resolution image with high-contrast targets from its
low-resolution counterparts. Since the infrared small target lacks color and
fine structure information, it is significant to exploit the supplementary
information among sequence images to enhance the target. In this paper, we
propose the first infrared small target SR method named local motion and
contrast prior driven deep network (MoCoPnet) to integrate the domain knowledge
of infrared small target into deep network, which can mitigate the intrinsic
feature scarcity of infrared small targets. Specifically, motivated by the
local motion prior in the spatio-temporal dimension, we propose a local
spatio-temporal attention module to perform implicit frame alignment and
incorporate the local spatio-temporal information to enhance the local features
(especially for small targets). Motivated by the local contrast prior in the
spatial dimension, we propose a central difference residual group to
incorporate the central difference convolution into the feature extraction
backbone, which can achieve center-oriented gradient-aware feature extraction
to further improve the target contrast. Extensive experiments have demonstrated
that our method can recover accurate spatial dependency and improve the target
contrast. Comparative results show that MoCoPnet can outperform the
state-of-the-art video SR and single image SR methods in terms of both SR
performance and target enhancement. Based on the SR results, we further
investigate the influence of SR on infrared small target detection and the
experimental results demonstrate that MoCoPnet promotes the detection
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/XinyiYing/MoCoPnet.</p>

            <p id="citation-30">Single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection aims at separating small
targets from clutter backgrounds on infrared images. Recently, deep learning
based methods have achieved promising performance on SIRST detection, but at
the cost of a large amount of training data with expensive pixel-level
annotations. To reduce the annotation burden, we propose the first method to
achieve SIRST detection with single-point supervision. The core idea of this
work is to recover the per-pixel mask of each target from the given single
point label by using clustering approaches, which looks simple but is indeed
challenging since targets are always insalient and accompanied with background
clutters. To handle this issue, we introduce randomness to the clustering
process by adding noise to the input images, and then obtain much more reliable
pseudo masks by averaging the clustered results. Thanks to this "Monte Carlo"
clustering approach, our method can accurately recover pseudo masks and thus
turn arbitrary fully supervised SIRST detection networks into weakly supervised
ones with only single point annotation. Experiments on four datasets
demonstrate that our method can be applied to existing SIRST detection networks
to achieve comparable performance with their fully supervised counterparts,
which reveals that single-point supervision is strong enough for SIRST
detection. Our code will be available at:

            <p id="citation-31">Space-based infrared tiny ship detection aims at separating tiny ships from
the images captured by earth orbiting satellites. Due to the extremely large
image coverage area (e.g., thousands square kilometers), candidate targets in
these images are much smaller, dimer, more changeable than those targets
observed by aerial-based and land-based imaging devices. Existing short imaging
distance-based infrared datasets and target detection methods cannot be well
adopted to the space-based surveillance task. To address these problems, we
develop a space-based infrared tiny ship detection dataset (namely,
NUDT-SIRST-Sea) with 48 space-based infrared images and 17598 pixel-level tiny
ship annotations. Each image covers about 10000 square kilometers of area with
10000X10000 pixels. Considering the extreme characteristics (e.g., small, dim,
changeable) of those tiny ships in such challenging scenes, we propose a
multi-level TransUNet (MTU-Net) in this paper. Specifically, we design a Vision
Transformer (ViT) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) hybrid encoder to extract
multi-level features. Local feature maps are first extracted by several
convolution layers and then fed into the multi-level feature extraction module
(MVTM) to capture long-distance dependency. We further propose a
copy-rotate-resize-paste (CRRP) data augmentation approach to accelerate the
training phase, which effectively alleviates the issue of sample imbalance
between targets and background. Besides, we design a FocalIoU loss to achieve
both target localization and shape description. Experimental results on the
NUDT-SIRST-Sea dataset show that our MTU-Net outperforms traditional and
existing deep learning based SIRST methods in terms of probability of
detection, false alarm rate and intersection over union.</p>
