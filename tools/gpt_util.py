                Given Abstract: Denoising diffusion models represent a recent emerging topic in computer vision, demonstrating remarkable results in the area of generative modeling. A diffusion model is a deep generative model that is based on two stages, a forward diffusion stage and a reverse diffusion stage. In the forward diffusion stage, the input data is gradually perturbed over several steps by adding Gaussian noise. In the reverse stage, a model is tasked at recovering the original input data by learning to gradually reverse the diffusion process, step by step. Diffusion models are widely appreciated for the quality and diversity of the generated samples, despite their known computational burdens, i.e., low speeds due to the high number of steps involved during sampling. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of articles on denoising diffusion models applied in vision, comprising both theoretical and practical contributions in the field. First, we identify and present three generic diffusion modeling frameworks, which are based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models, noise conditioned score networks, and stochastic differential equations. We further discuss the relations between diffusion models and other deep generative models, including variational auto-encoders, generative adversarial networks, energy-based models, autoregressive models and normalizing flows. Then, we introduce a multi-perspective categorization of diffusion models applied in computer vision. Finally, we illustrate the current limitations of diffusion models and envision some interesting directions for future research.'''},

# also makes the self-attentions collapse into homogeneity for all query tokens and
# heads. Such homogeneity of self-attention reduces the diversity of representations,
# worsening scalability and dense prediction performance. (2) CL utilizes the lowfrequency signals of the representations, but MIM utilizes high-frequencies. Since
# low- and high-frequency information respectively represent shapes and textures,
# CL is more shape-oriented and MIM more texture-oriented. (3) CL plays a crucial
# role in the later layers, while MIM mainly focuses on the early layers. Upon these

# abstract = "Training a referring expression comprehension (ReC) model for a new visual domain requires collecting referring expressions, and potentially corresponding bounding boxes, for images in the domain. While large-scale pre-trained models are useful for image classification across domains, it remains unclear if they can be applied in a zero-shot manner to more complex tasks like ReC. We present ReCLIP, a simple but strong zero-shot baseline that repurposes CLIP, a state-of-the-art large-scale model, for ReC. Motivated by the close connection between ReC and CLIP's contrastive pre-training objective, the first component of ReCLIP is a region-scoring method that isolates object proposals via cropping and blurring, and passes them to CLIP. However, through controlled experiments on a synthetic dataset, we find that CLIP is largely incapable of performing spatial reasoning off-the-shelf. Thus, the second component of ReCLIP is a spatial relation resolver that handles several types of spatial relations. We reduce the gap between zero-shot baselines from prior work and supervised models by as much as 29% on RefCOCOg, and on RefGTA (video game imagery), ReCLIP's relative improvement over supervised ReC models trained on real images is 8%."

Abstract — The aim of this paper is to give an introductory
review of the cryoelectron microscopy as a complex data source
for the most of the system biology branches, including the most
perspective non-local approaches known as "localomics" and
"dynamomics". A brief summary of various cryoelectron microscopy methods and corresponding system biological approaches is given in the text. The above classification can be
considered as a useful framework for the primary comprehensions about cryoelectron microscopy aims and instrumental
tools
